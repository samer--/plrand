v0.2 - Added a build option in root Makefile to allow compilation without GSL.

v0.3 - Several changes:

	+ Replaced generator algorithm with one based on Pierre l'Ecuyer's
	  combined multiple recursive generator as found in his RngStreams package.
	  This has a much longer period (about 2^191) and support for jumping
	  a known number of samples ahead in the stream.

	+ Sampled real values now have double precision (53 bits) as opposed to
	  single precision.

	+ Added spawn/3 for sampling an entire new stream from a given generator,
	  by sampling enough data to determine a new generator state.

	+ Added init_jump/2, double_jump/2, and jump/3, to support jumping ahead
	  a known number of samples in the stream. The jump must be a power of 2
	  and can be very large.

	+ Added sampling method for a Dirichlet distribution with an arbitrary
	  base measure. Uses the stick-breaking construction to represent the
	  infinite discrete distribution which results from sampling from a DP.
	  spawn/3 or split/3 are used to generate the infinite stream of random values
	  required to construct the sample; this is represented as a lazy list. 
	  The base measure can be any of the distributions handled by sample/4.

	+ Removed all foreign interface functions that use or set the global
	  random generator state, except for set_rnd_state/1, get_rnd_state/1,
	  sample_Single_/1 and sample_Double_/1.

	  sample_Single_/1 and sample_Double_/1 are retained for situations where
	  performance is an issue - they use and update the global state and
	  are faster.

v0.4 - Fixes to GSL client code and other minor changes

	+ top Makefile now points to /opt/local for GSL (good for MacPorts)
	+ Makefile now handles HAVE_GSL flag better
	+ added \\ operator to sampling language for escapes to prolog predicate
	+ Minor changes to plrand.c and plrand.pl

v0.5 - Fixes for 64 bit architectures and removal of dirichlet processes

	+ unsigned long changed to unsigned (ie explicitly 32 bit int) in
	  RngStream and plrand, now work on 64 bit architectures where long
	  is 64 bits. This fixes randomise/1 which was broken by 64 bit.

	+ sample/4 and rv/2 are now multifile so can be extended by user.

	+ Removed Dirichlet process and GEM (stick breaking construction) to
	  a separate module (not included).

	+ Removed str_sample/4.

v0.6 - Fix to prevent memory corruption plus a few enhancements

	+ Change to BLOB flags seems to be enough to prevent bizarre memory
	  corruption problem that was affecting host Prolog.

	+ Added term representation of random state to facilitate persistent
	  storage
